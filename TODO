Core module
- handle EVERYTHING with signals! nothing inside irc.cpp should use out() because this bot is going to be scripted through
  external modules!
- avoid assertion fails (how?)
- create a connection error handler, because the only clue we have if we got disconnected, is the signal sent by 
  QTcpSocket, and it's too late to know why we disconnected :( it's very easy because it's sent in an only raw:
     ERROR :Closing Link: invitado-124158 by urano2.irc-hispano.org (Quit: quit msg)
  or whatever.
- make separate procedures for privmsg and notice (yes, now it does work, but i want it to work better)
- handle unhandled numerics
- signals for everything
- fill a QStringList with nicks in channel AND MODES on join
- ctcp replies
- SPLIT EVERYTHING IN MODULES!
- mirc colors: handle them or wipe them
- handle /me command
- handle unhandled raws like MODE or TOPIC

Lurker module
- mode handling
- o/c, nicklist on join
- show chanmode before nick on chanmsg
- show common channels on querymsg
- handle server, chans, and everything configurable using QConfig (because hardcoding sucks)
